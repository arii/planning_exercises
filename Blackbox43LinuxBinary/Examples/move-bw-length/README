Domain: blocks-world
Version: prodigy-bw-length

Same as prodigy-bw, but with (:length) specified.

The same as the domain "prodigy-bw" in the PDDL 1.3 distribution with
renamed examples and added examples from the paper

		Henry Kautz and Bart Selman, "Pushing the Envelope:
		Planning, Propositional Logic, and Stochastic Search",
		Proc. AAAI-96.

The default settings for problems
	bw-large-c.pddl
	bw-large-d.pddl
cause out of memory errors for blackbox.  bw-large-c.pddl
can be solved using the following options:
	-axioms compact -solver compact -l -then satz -cutoff 40 
		-restart 20 -then satz -cutoff 400
Currently bw-large-d.pddl is still too large (over 40,000 vars and
4,000,000 clauses).
