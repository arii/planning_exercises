Domain: woodshop
Version: woodshop-strips

This is the woodshop-strips subset of the PDDL 1.3 distribution
	strict-domains/woodshop/domain02.pddl

This domain exercises the code that parses :constants.
Blackbox version 2 works fine on this domain.
However, in other domains the use of :constants seems
to trigger a bug (core dump).
