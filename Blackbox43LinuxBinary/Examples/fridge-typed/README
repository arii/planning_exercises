Domain: fridge
Version: fridge-domain-typed

The same as the domain "fridge-domain-typed" in the
PDDL 1.3 distribution

	strict-domains/fridge/domain01.pddl

but with the following changes to the problem files:
	"fridge" was used as a type in the domain file, but
		as a unary predicate in the prob* files.
		This is changed so that fridge is used
		as a type in the problem files as well.
